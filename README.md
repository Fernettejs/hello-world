Just a little about me. 

Hello All, 

I am currently Public Safety Officer (police and firefighter) who wants to code. I graduated from the University of Michigan after getting out of the United States Marine Corps. After being in law-enforcement for a couple of years, I've decided that I am changing career paths and going into a coding career. I am learning so much and loving every part of it.
